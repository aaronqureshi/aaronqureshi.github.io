        <h1> About Me </h1>         
        
        <p> <strong> Hello! My name is Aaron Qureshi. I'm striving to learn more about computer science towards pursuing a career in cyber security. I've been building computers since I was 15 and have always been curious as to how the internal proceses of websites, computers, and software are created. I hope to fill this online portfolio full of work I am proud to have made.</strong> </p>
        
        <p> <strong> I have been working on computer based projects since I learned to type. The new challenges of creating presentable work online is familiar and welcomed. Whether it's be myself or with friends, I've always enjoyed creating computer graphics, websites, and other internet-based projects. The one that fills me with the most pride was when me and my friends created a website named EnomView.com, which recieved awards and event invitations, leading to a very fun summer.</strong> </p>
